               Almost half of the world's mangoes are cultivated in India alone, with the second-largest source being
               Indonesia. Although India is the largest producer of mangoes, it accounts for less than 1% of the
               international mango trade; India consumes most of its own production.

               Mango grows well on wide variety of soils, such as lateritic, alluvial, sandy loam and sandy. The loamy,
               alluvial, well-drained, aerated and deep soils (2-2.5 m) rich in organic matter with a pH range of
               5.5-7.5
               are ideal for mango cultivation.

               Planting is usually done in the month of July-August in rainfed areas and during February-March in
               irrigated
               areas. In case of heavy rainfall zones, planting is taken up at the end of the rainy season.

               In the 2021/2022 crop year, China was the leading producer of apples worldwide. During that time period,
               China's apple production amounted to almost 46 million metric tons.

               Apple trees will tolerate a wide range of different soil textures, depth, acidity, and structure, as long
               as
               they are well draining and fertile.The best soil for apple trees are well draining medium-clay to sandy
               loam, fertile soils with slightly acidic to neutral pH between 5.8 and 6.5.

               depend on where you live, but March and April are ideal for most growers. If you live in a warmer climate
               (USDA zones seven and warmer), it's also possible to start planting in the fall.

               India is the top country by bananas production in the world. As of 2021, bananas production in India was
               33.1 million tonnes that accounts for 26.40% of the world's bananas production. The top 5 countries
               (others
               are China, Indonesia, Brazil, and Ecuador) account for 53.79% of it.

               The soil suitable for banana should be 0.5 1m in depth, rich, well drained, fertile, moisture retentive,
               containing plenty of organic matter. The range of pH should be 6.5-7.5. Alluvial and volcanic soils are

               Four months of monsoon (June to September) with an average 650-750 mm. rainfall are most important for
               vigorous vegetative growth of banana. At higher altitudes, banana cultivation is restricted to a few
               varieties like Hill banana.

               global orange producer, with production volume of about 16.9 million metric tons. That year, the global
               production volume of fresh oranges amounted to about 49.01 million metric tons.

               Orange crop grows well in a wide range of soil including the alluvial, sandy loam, and red sand soil.
               However, soil properties like fertility, drainage, and PH concentration are important factors to be
               considered. Orange crops can either be irrigated in an orchard or rain fed in case of reliable rains.

               <strong class="point"> The best planting season for Oranges:</strong>

               <br>
               Oranges grow well in both tropical and sub-tropical climate. For maximum yield and best crop growth, dry
               conditions characterized by low rainfalls ranging between 75 and 250 cm are most favorable conditions.
               High
               humidity and frost conditions are a perfect environment for the spread of diseases in orange crops while
               hot
               winds cause the plant to lose its flowers and young fruits.

               Grapes can be cultivated in variety of soils including sandy loams, sandy clay loams, red sandy soils,
               shallow to medium black soils and red loams. The soil should be well drained, having good water
               holding capacity and devoid of any hard pan or impervious layer in the top 90-cm, with water table at
               least 6.5m below. Grapes can also be grown successfully over a wide range of soil pH (4.0-9.5)
               however, soils having pH range of 6.5-8.0 are considered ideal.
