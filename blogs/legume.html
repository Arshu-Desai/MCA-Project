               India is the main producer of green grams in the world and almost grown in all the States. It is grown in
               around 36 lakh hectares of land with the total production of around 17 lakh tonnes of grain with a
               productivity of around 500 kg/hectare.

               Moong Dal can be cultivated on a wide range of soil. It gives the best results when grown on well-drained
               loamy, sandy-loam soils. Waterlogged and saline soils are not suitable for cultivation. Loam to sandy
               loam
               soils is considered the best soil for mung bean cultivation.

               plant spacing of 10 cm for Kharif sowing. For Rabi sowing use row spacing of 22.5 cm and plant to plant
               spacing of 7 cm. Sow seeds at depth of 4-6 cm.

               various
               agro-climatic zones of India. Planting of early pigeon pea or Toor Dal before the onset of monsoon in
               the
               month of June is recommended for higher yields.

               For lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils, which drain water easily, are required. Lentil does
               not
               tolerate flooded or waterlogged soils, and does best on loamy soils. Roots of plants get enough water,
               air,
               and space to grow.

               Over the last several years, India has been the top producer of chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans,
               worldwide. In 2021, the production volume of chickpeas in India amounted to almos 12 million metric tons.
               Australia came in second at an estimated 876.5 thousand metric tons of chickpeas.

               Chickpea crops are best suited to well-drained loam and clay loam soils that are neutral to alkaline (pH
               6.0
               to 9.0) and have good water holding capacity. Sowing will vary between varieties, but can start as early
               as
               mid May to the start of July.
