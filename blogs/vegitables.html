               China is the largest onion producer in the world with 23,907,509 tonnes production volume per year. India
               comes second with 19,415,425 tonnes yearly production.

               <strong class="point">Soil:</strong>
               <br>
               Onions can be grown on all types of soil such as sandy loam, silt loam and heavy clay soils.
               However, deep friable, highly fertile sandy loam to clay soil rich in humus is considered as ideal.
               Sandy soil needs frequent irrigation and favours early maturity. Whereas heavy soils restrict the
               development of bulbs and the crop matures late as compared to light soils. A pH range between
               5.8-6.5 is considered as optimum. Good drainage is essential as water-logging results in total
               failure of the crop

               Indian onions has two crop cycles, first harvesting starts in November to January and the second
               harvesting from January to May. The onion is a hardy cool-season biennial but usually grown as annual
               crop.

               The total value of the potato crop was $3.88 billion (NASS 2020). China is now the world's top potato
               producer, followed by India, Russia, and Ukraine. During the current year, Uttar Pradesh is the major
               Potato producing State with 31.26% of production share,
               followed by West Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with 23.29 %, 13.22%, 7.43% and 6.20% share
               respectively.

               The potato can be grown almost on any type of soil except saline and alkaline soils. Soils, which are
               naturally loose, offer least resistance to the enlargement of the tubers is preferred. Loamy and sandy
               loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration are most suitable for cultivation of
               potato crop. The soil with pH range of 5.2-6.4 is considered to be ideal.

               Early potatoes can be harvested as early as mid-June and second earlies take a few more weeks to mature,
               being ready to dig up around July and August. Harvesting of maincrop potatoes usually takes place later,
               from late August to October.

               China is the world's leading producer of cauliflower. Green cauliflower is produced when you cross
               cauliflower with broccoli.In india some of the states that produce large quantities of cauliflower are
               Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha and
               Karnataka.

               mid-September and October to first week of November is best transplanting for late varieties. Use spacing
               of
               45x45 cm for main season crop whereas for early and late maturing crop use spacing of 45x30 cm.

               Production. In 2020, world production of cabbages (combined with other brassicas) was 71 million tonnes,
               led
               by China with 48% of the world total (table). Other substantial producers were India, Russia, and South

               Grow cabbage in well-drained yet moisture-retentive, fertile soil with a pH of 6 to 7. Improve your soil
               by
               adding well-rotted manure or compost in spring or fall.

               <br>
               Early cabbage is sown during July-November in plains and April-August in hills, as these require a longer
               period for their head formation. About 300-500g of seed are sufficient for raising nursery required to
               plant
               one hectare.
