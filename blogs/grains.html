               China is the world's largest wheat producer and has yielded more than 2.4 billion tonnes of wheat in the
               last 20 years, around 17% of total production. Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of wheat in India.
               The most important food crop in Uttar Pradesh is
               wheat. Uttar Pradesh contributed 32.42% of the total wheat production in India.

               <strong class="point">Soil:</strong>
               <br>
               Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, clay and silt particles. It consists of additional organic matter and is
               very fertile compared to other soils. It provides ideal nutrients which are required for growing wheat
               and
               also allows the roots of the plant to rapidly absorb water and air from the soil.

               <br>
               Wheat is a Rabi crop, grown in the winter season. Sowing of wheat takes place in October to December and
               harvesting is during February to May.

               The highest producer of Jowar in India is Maharashtra which accounts for around 54 percent of the total
               production.

               <strong class="point">Soil:</strong>
               <br>
               Jowar can be grown on less fertile soils and requires moderate rainfall and moderate temperature.
               Specifically, alluvial soil or mixed black soil and red soil are perfect for Jowar.

               <strong class="point"> The best planting season for Jowar:</strong>

               <br>
               Jowar is cultivated in North India during Kharif season.
               The month of April-July is best suited for its sowing.

               China is the world's largest producer of rice, followed by India and Indonesia. West Bengal ranks no. 1
               with a total rice production of 146.05 lakh tons. It is the highest rice producing
               state in India with a yield of 2600 kilograms per hectare.

               <br>
               The soil that is good for growing rice is a loamy or clayey soil, rich in organic matter and has a
               neutral
               to slightly acidic pH between 6.0 and 7.5.

               The main rice growing season in the country is the 'Kharif'. It is known as winter rice as per the
               harvesting time. The sowing time of winter (kharif) rice is June-July and it is harvested in
               November-December.

               India is at first place in Bajra production in the world. Rajasthan is the largest producer of bajra
               followed by Uttar Pradesh.

               Bajra can be cultivated in a variety of soil types. It does, however, thrive best in black cotton soils
               and
               sandy loam soils with good drainage.

               <br>
               For grain Bajra should be sown from july to mid august and for fodder purpose it can be sown from last
               week
               of june to first week of july'. Bajra should be sown at the depth of 4cmin lines with a spacing of 45cm.

               I The United States is the largest producer, consumer, and exporter of corn in the world. On average,
               U.S.
               farmers plant about 90 million acres of corn each year, with the majority of the crop grown in the
               Heartland
               region. The predominant maize growing states that contributes more than 80 % of the total maize
               production are
               Andhra Pradesh (20.9 %), Karnataka (16.5 %), Rajasthan (9.9 %), Maharashtra (9.1 %), Bihar (8.9 %), Uttar
               Pradesh (6.1 %), Madhya Pradesh (5.7 %), Himachal Pradesh (4.4 %).

               <strong class="point">Soil:</strong>
               <br>
               The ideal soil for corn is well drained and fertile, with a pH of 6.0-6.8. As a general rule, plant early
               corn in light soil (sand or loam) and later corn in heavier soil (silt or clay), when there is an option.
               Light soils warm up faster than heavy soils, so seed germinates more readily.
               <br>

               <strong class="point"> The best planting season for Corn:</strong>

               <br>
               Generally, growers maximize corn yield if they plant in late April or early May (Table 1). When spring
               arrives early, a mid-April planting date produces similar yield if young plants are not damaged by a
               freeze
               in May.
