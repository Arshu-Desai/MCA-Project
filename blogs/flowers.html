               accounts for a huge portion of the world's flower exports.

               Roses are very adaptable and can be grown in almost any soil type given it is well drained, deep and full
               of humus (decayed organic matter). However, the best soils are those of a medium to heavy loam to a
               minimum of 35cm, over a good clay sub-soil.
               The soil pH for roses should sit between 6.5 and 7.

               <br>
               Roses are best planted in the spring (after the last frost) or in fall (at least six weeks before your
               average first frost). Planting early enough in fall gives the roots enough time to get established before
               the plants go dormant over the winter.

               Marigolds can grow in many soil types except heavy clay as it does not drain well enough. They prefer a
               slightly acidic soil pH between 6.2 and 7 but can adapt to soils slightly out of this range. Moderately
               fertile soils are suitable, but highly fertile loam is preferred for the quickest growth and prolific
               flowering..

               but
               the tall African marigolds are best planted right away in the spring (after danger of frost has passed)

               sunflower producer, followed by Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu.
               Russia had the highest projected production volume of sunflower seeds of any country in the world in the
               2022/2023 crop year. During that time period, Russia produced around 16.5 million metric tons of
               sunflower

               Sunflowers generally grow best on well-drained soils.
               They are tolerant of clay loam or silty clay loam soils, and perform well on sandy loam soils.
               Sunflowers do best when grown in slightly acidic soil with a pH from 6.0 to 6.8.

               <br>
               Plant sunflowers in late spring, once the ground is nice and warm. Most sunflowers germinate when soil
               has
               reached 70 to 85 degrees F. The best time to plant sunflowers is just before the soil reaches this
               temperature.

               potting
               soil, peat moss, and sand. However, preference for soil type (sandy, loamy or clay) depends on the
